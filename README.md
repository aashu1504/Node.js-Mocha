# Node, WebdriverJS and Promises


Node:

Node.js uses asynchronous programming!
Node.js is free, runs on various platforms (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc.) and uses JavaScript on the server.


WebDriverJs:

WebDriverJs is the javascript implementation of selenium. It uses the Selenium's Json-wire-protocol to interact with browser as selenium java does.
Webdriverjs is packaged as 'selenium-webdriver'under npm package which runs on nodejs.

Promise:

WebdriverJS uses Promises for all of its interactions with a browser. Promises have a "then" method which can be used to get the eventual return value of the operation.

Testing Framework - Mocha:

Mocha is a JavaScript test framework which runs on Node.js and in the browser. Mocha tests run serially, allowing for flexible and accurate reporting.

Reporting - Mocha Awesome:

Mocha Awesome is a custom Mocha Test reporter which generates test results in an HTML and JSON File.
